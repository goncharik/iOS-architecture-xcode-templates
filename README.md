## Introduction

When developing iOS apps, it's important to follow well-established architecture patterns to maintain clean and maintainable code. This project aims to simplify the process of making new modules of the app with the following architecture patterns:

- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) in both UIKit and SwiftUI
- MVVM+C (Model-View-ViewModel + Coordinators) in both UIKit and SwiftUI
- TCA (The Composible Architecture) in SwiftUI

These Xcode templates will help you kickstart your iOS project with your preferred architecture pattern, saving you time and ensuring a consistent codebase.

## Features

- Easily create new modules for your iOS projects with your choice of architecture pattern.
- Customizable templates to suit your project's specific needs.
- Comes with boilerplate code to get you started quickly.
- Support for both UIKit and SwiftUI

## Installation

To install the Xcode templates, simply run the `install-xcode-templates.sh` script provided in this repository.

```shell
./install-xcode-templates.sh
```

This script will copy the templates to the appropriate directory in your Xcode templates folder.

## Usage

1. Open Xcode.
2. Open your project or create new one
3. Create a new file (File > New > File...).
4. Choose the "iOS" tab and scroll down to "Architecture" section
5. You should see new templates like "MVVM+C SwiftUI", "MVVM+C UIKit", and "TCA Feature"
6. Select your preferred architecture pattern, and Xcode will generate files for the whole module for you
